  <p>Automated science uses AI to plan, execute and interpret experiments without
    human intervention. Automated science platforms combine three technologies:
    laboratory robots that perform physical experiments, a machine learning model
    that predicts results and an AI agent that plans future experiments. The fast-growing
    field of automated science includes self-driving labs, robot scientists, and
    AI systems that enhance human experimenters.

  <p><a href="http://jensenlab.net">Paul Jensen</a> (University of Michigan)
    and <a href="http://hendrickslab.com">Mark Hendricks</a> (Whitman College)
    teach a workshop that introduces automated science and shows how automation,
    modeling, and AI fit together
    into a closed-loop, autonomous system. The workshop also emphasizes the interfaces
    between technologies, e.g., how to modify machine learning models for use with
    a planning agent or the liquid handling challenges that arise from AI-planned
    experiments. Case studies in biology and chemistry highlight state-of-the-art
    automated science systems.

  <p><b>Module 1: Introduction to Automated Science.</b> (4 hours)
    The first module introduces the "plan <texttt>-></texttt> experiment <texttt>-></texttt> model"
    strategy and the Bayesian optimization framework for identifying optimal experiments.
    Participtants will develop a conceptual understanding of the explore vs. exploit tradeoff
    and the constratints on optimal learning. This module is designed to get automated engineers,
     scientists, and modelers on the same page and assumes no prior knowledge of AI.

  <p><b>Module 2: Hands-on Automated Science.</b> (4 hours)
    Participants will apply the techniques from Module 1 to build an AI system that learns
    to aim a tabletop catapult. Teams will design a learning strategy, collect data, and
    train a simple machine learning model using a Python software library. Ideally, each team of
    2-4 participants would have one member with basic Python programming skills.

  <p><b>Module 3: Experiment Design and Automated Quality Control.</b> (4 hours)
    The third module explains how classical design of experiments (DOE) can enhance modern
    automated science systems. Topics include factor screening, pooling designs, hybrid designs,
    and resposne surface methodology (RSM). The module also introduces techniques from
    statistical quality control that can be deployed autonomously to monitor AI-driven labs.

  <p><b>Module 4: Modeling for Automated Science.</b> (4 hours)
    The final module dives deeper into the machine learning methods used to
    implement automated science systems.
    Topics include Gaussian Process Regression, Bayesian machine learning,
    optimization-based policies, batching/parallel experiments, hybrid experiments,
    and interpretation. This module is designed for participants with a computational
    background and assumes a basic understanding of machine learning concepts.

  <p><b>Audience and Background:</b> Attendees will learn from instructors who have assembled automated science pipelines
    in biology and chemistry. The course requires only a basic understanding of statistics
    and laboratory automation (except Module 4, which is designed for participants with a computational background).
    Practitioners with expertise in one technology (e.g., machine learning or lab automation) are encouraged to attend and learn
    how to combine their knowledge with other parts of an automated science platform.

  <p><b>Format:</b> Workshops last 4-16 hours (depending on the number of modules), split over 1-2 days.
    Workshops can be held at a single company/institution, or multiple groups can work together to host
    an open workshop. Workshops can also be taught at conferences or sponsored by government/industry partnerships.
    <b>Please contact Paul Jensen (pjens@umich.edu) if you are interested in hosting a workshop.</b>
