Our goal is to understand the intracellular and inter-species networks underlying bacterial physiology. By perturbing cellular or community networks, we aim to treat or prevent infection with minimal damage to the human microbiome. We focus primarily on pathogenic streptococci and their roles in pediatric disease and oral health, although tools from our group have also been applied to problems in bacterial ecology and bioenergy.
