<td class="ppl-bio"><b>Paul Jensen</b> <p class="ppl-title">Principal Investigator</p>
I trained as an engineer and microbiologist at the University of Minnesota, the
University of Virginia, and Boston College. In 2016, I joined the bioengineering
faculty at Illinois to mentor students in systems microbiology, artificial intelligence,
and automated science. I enjoy reading and gardening with my wife and two children.

<td class="ppl-bio"><b>Kenan Jijakli</b> <p class="ppl-title">Graduate Student</p>
I joined the Jensen Lab in 2016 as a Ph.D. student, and I am working on inferring
gene expression states by combining high-throughput growth experiments with models.
In my spare time I get lost on Wikipedia, walk and talk with friends, and read.

<td class="ppl-image"><img src="/img/people/Ryan_Wyllie.png" width=160px></td>
<td class="ppl-bio"><b>Ryan Wyllie</b> <p class="ppl-title">Graduate Student</p>
I graduated from UIUC in 2016 with a B.S. in bioengineering and a minor in
chemistry. After working at Argonne National Lab as a summer research assistant,
I joined the Jensen Lab in the fall of 2016 as an M.S student but switched into
the PhD program that summer. My research primarily focuses on the development of
synthetic biology tools that can be used to answer questions regarding gene
function and gene expression in the oral streptococci. Outside of lab, I enjoy
running, political philosophy, the history of Late Antiquity, and ancient Roman
numismatics.

<td class="ppl-image"><img src="/img/people/Walden_Li.png" width=160px></td>
<td class="ppl-bio"><b>Walden Li</b> <p class="ppl-title">Graduate Student</p>
I received my B.S in Biological Science (Public Administration minor) at Zhejiang
University in China in 2015, focusing on microbiology, and M.S. in Bioengineering
at UIUC in 2018, focusing on host-synthetic circuit interaction in <i>E. coli</i>. In
the Jensen lab I’m working on the genetics, metabolism, and social behaviors of
oral streptococci, particularly the oral pathogen <i>S. sobrinus</i>. The Jensen lab
has been a great place for both being a researcher and being a human. Outside
the lab I’m drawn to the great outdoors.

<td class="ppl-image"><img src="/img/people/Adam_Dama.png" width=160px></td>
<td class="ppl-bio"><b>Adam Dama</b> <p class="ppl-title">Automation Engineer, Software</p>
I graduated from UIUC in 2019 with a B.S. in bioengineering and a minor in computer
science. I joined the Jensen Lab in 2017 as a sophomore where I began working on
small lab devices like a miniaturized plate reader and a bacteria colony tracker.
After graduation, I joined the lab full-time as an automation software engineer
to wrangle some robots and establish our “Deep Phenotyping” high-throughput
assay pipeline. Currently, I am working on AI-driven approaches to combinatorial
problems we face as microbiologists. Beyond the lab, I enjoy photography, wasting
my time learning useless things on YouTube, and, when I get the chance, channeling
my inner Roger Federer.

<td class="ppl-image"><img src="/img/people/Deepthi_Suresh.png" width=160px></td>
<td class="ppl-bio"><b>Deepthi Suresh</b> <p class="ppl-title">Graduate Student</p>
I graduated from UIUC in 2019 with a B.S. in Bioengineering. I joined Jensen Lab
the summer of 2018 and have continued on in the lab for my M.S. in Bioengineering.
I began by working on laboratory automation, integrating robotic systems into
the lab's workflow. I continue that work now by studying different gel
biomaterials that would allow for bacteria suspension with the use of pipetting
robots. I am also researching the career outcome expectations of students in the
field of AI, as part of a new engineering education project that the lab is
undertaking. In my free time I enjoy hiking, playing ultimate frisbee, and
watching movies!

<td class="ppl-bio"><b>Kevin Kim</b> <p class="ppl-title">Lab Technician</p>
I graduated from UIC in 2019 with a B.S. in Biological Sciences and part of the
GPPA Medical Scholars program. I joined the Jensen Lab in early 2020 and I am
performing full time research during my gap year before starting medical school
next fall at the UIC College of Medicine at Peoria. I am currently working on
developing the Deep Phenotyping pipeline and establishing a method to rapidly
knockout genes in <i>Streptococcus mutans</i>. Outside of the lab, I enjoy playing
tennis, spending time with friends, and giving my cat way more attention than
she wants.

<td class="ppl-bio"><b>Benjamin David</b> <p class="ppl-title">Graduate Student</p>
I graduated from UIUC in May 2020 with a B.S. in bioengineering. I joined the
Jensen Lab in the fall of 2019 as an undergraduate, and I have continued to work
in the lab as a graduate student. I am currently working on implementing a low
cost RNA-seq library preparation workflow for the lab, and I am interested in
using that workflow to model how oral streptococci respond to combinations of
stressors. In my free time, I like to play golf, hike, and play my saxophone.

<td class="ppl-bio"><b>Danielle Leyva</b> <p class="ppl-title">Lab Technician</p>
I graduated from UIUC in 2020 with a B.S. in Molecular and Cellular Biology.
I joined the Jensen Lab in 2019 as a part of the Deep Phenotyping team.
I am currently working as a full time lab technician during my gap semester
before starting dental school next fall at UIC's College of Dentistry.
I conduct automated experiments in systems microbiology and analyze data
related to the lab's research. Outside of the lab, I enjoy training for
triathlons, cooking, and hiking.
