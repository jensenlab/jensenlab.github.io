<td class="ppl-image"><img src="/img/people/Paul_Jensen.jpg" width=160px></td>
<td class="ppl-bio"><b>Paul Jensen</b> <p class="ppl-title">Principal Investigator</p>
I trained as an engineer and microbiologist at the University of Minnesota, the
University of Virginia, and Boston College. In 2016, I joined the bioengineering
faculty at Illinois to mentor students in systems microbiology, artificial intelligence,
and automated science. I enjoy reading and gardening with my wife and two children.

<td class="ppl-image"><img src="/img/people/Ryan_Wyllie.png" width=160px></td>
<td class="ppl-bio"><b>Ryan Wyllie</b> <p class="ppl-title">Graduate Student</p>
I graduated from UIUC in 2016 with a B.S. in bioengineering and a minor in
chemistry. After working at Argonne National Lab as a summer research assistant,
I joined the Jensen Lab in the fall of 2016 as an M.S student but switched into
the PhD program that summer. My research primarily focuses on the development of
synthetic biology tools that can be used to answer questions regarding gene
function and gene expression in the oral streptococci. Outside of lab, I enjoy
running, political philosophy, the history of Late Antiquity, and ancient Roman
numismatics.

<td class="ppl-bio"><b>Adam Dama</b> <p class="ppl-title">Automation Engineer, Software</p>
I graduated from UIUC in 2019 with a B.S. in bioengineering and a minor in computer
science. I joined the Jensen Lab in 2017 as a sophomore where I began working on
small lab devices like a miniaturized plate reader and a bacteria colony tracker.
After graduation, I joined the lab full-time as an automation software engineer
to wrangle some robots and establish our “Deep Phenotyping” high-throughput
assay pipeline. Currently, I am working on AI-driven approaches to combinatorial
problems we face as microbiologists. Beyond the lab, I enjoy photography, wasting
my time learning useless things on YouTube, and, when I get the chance, channeling
my inner Roger Federer.

<td class="ppl-bio"><b>Deepthi Suresh</b> <p class="ppl-title">Graduate Student</p>
I graduated from UIUC in 2019 with a B.S. in Bioengineering. I joined Jensen Lab
the summer of 2018 and have continued on in the lab for my M.S. in Bioengineering.
I began by working on laboratory automation, integrating robotic systems into
the lab's workflow. I continue that work now by studying different gel
biomaterials that would allow for bacteria suspension with the use of pipetting
robots. I am also researching the career outcome expectations of students in the
field of AI, as part of a new engineering education project that the lab is
undertaking. In my free time I enjoy hiking, playing ultimate frisbee, and
watching movies!

<td class="ppl-bio"><b>Benjamin David</b> <p class="ppl-title">Graduate Student</p>
I graduated from UIUC in May 2020 with a B.S. in Bioengineering. I joined the
Jensen Lab in the fall of 2019 as an undergraduate, and I have continued to work
in the lab as a graduate student. I am currently working on implementing a low
cost RNA-seq library preparation workflow for the lab, and I am interested in
using that workflow to model how oral streptococci respond to combinations of
stressors. In my free time, I like to play golf, hike, and play my saxophone.

<td class="ppl-bio"><b>Brendan Brasch</b> <p class="ppl-title">Graduate Student</p>
I graduated from UIUC in 2021 with a B.S. in Bioengineering and a minor in
Computer Science. I joined the Jensen Lab in 2021 as an Masters student and a
member of the Deep Phenotyping team. I plan to start research in
laboratory automation, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. In my
free time, I enjoy cooking, hiking, producing music, and DJing!

<td class="ppl-bio"><b>Kurt Kostan</b> <p class="ppl-title">Graduate Student</p>
  I received my B.S. in Bioengineering from UIUC in 2019 and joined the Jensen
  Lab in the summer of 2021. Beginning my work in the lab, I focused on
   automating CRISPR technology to probe microbial genomes and implementing
   artificial intelligence approaches for rapid de novo mapping of microbial
   metabolic networks. Outside of the lab, I enjoy experimenting with new food,
   playing games, and fixating on my hobby of the month.

  I graduated from UIUC in 2021 with a B.S. in Bioengineering and a minor in Business.
  I joined the Jensen Lab in the summer of 2021 as a part of the Deep Phenotyping team.
  I am working as a full time quality engineer for the fall. I perform automated
  experiments using the Deep Phenotyping pipeline. Outside the lab, I spend my time
  listening to music, reading, and watching YouTube videos on the craft of storytelling.
