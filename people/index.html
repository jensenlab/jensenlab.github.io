<td class="ppl-bio"><b>Paul Jensen</b> <p class="ppl-title">Principal Investigator</p>
I trained as an engineer and microbiologist at the University of Minnesota, the
University of Virginia, and Boston College. I joined the biomedical engineering
faculty at Michigan to mentor students in systems microbiology, artificial intelligence,
and automated science. I enjoy reading and gardening with my wife and two children.

<td class="ppl-bio"><b>Ryan Wyllie</b> <p class="ppl-title">Research Faculty</p>
I graduated from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign in 2016 with a B.S. in
bioengineering and a minor in chemistry. Following a summer of research at Argonne
National Laboratory, I joined the Jensen Lab in the fall of 2016 and graduated with
my PhD in bioengineering from UIUC during the summer of 2022. Currently, I work on
developing novel genetic technologies for controlling and monitoring bacterial gene
expression. I’m also interested in leveraging the combination of statistical design
of experiments with laboratory automation to accelerate the process of characterizing
non-model organisms. Outside of lab, I enjoy running, hiking, political philosophy,
the history of Late Antiquity, and ancient numismatics.

<td class="ppl-bio"><b>Deepthi Suresh</b> <p class="ppl-title">Graduate Student</p>
I earned my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Bioengineering at the University
of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. I began my research in 2018, working on integrating
robotic systems into lab workflow. I am now at the University of Michigan working
towards my PhD in Biomedical Engineering with a research focus in engineering
education. I was a teaching assistant for three years in an introductory lab course
which, along with my own undergraduate experience, influenced my research interests:
undergraduate career outcome expectations for bioengineering, currently with respect
to the fields of artificial intelligence and quality engineering. In my free time,
I love playing ultimate frisbee, hiking, and spending time with my two cats, Percy and Apollo.

<td class="ppl-bio"><b>Benjamin David</b> <p class="ppl-title">Graduate Student</p>
I completed my undergraduate and master’s degrees in bioengineering at the University
of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. In 2019, I joined the Jensen Lab as an undergraduate
and continued working in the lab toward a PhD following my graduation in 2020. In
the Summer of 2022, I relocated to the University of Michigan along with the Jensen
Lab. My research interests include low-cost functional genomics, reinforcement learning,
statistical design of biological experiments, and BME lab education. In my free time,
I enjoy reading, board games, and a variety of sports.

<td class="ppl-bio"><b>Kurt Kostan</b> <p class="ppl-title">Graduate Student</p>
  I received my B.S. in Bioengineering from UIUC in 2019 and joined the Jensen
  Lab in the summer of 2021. Beginning my work in the lab, I focused on
   automating CRISPR technology to probe microbial genomes and implementing
   artificial intelligence approaches for rapid de novo mapping of microbial
   metabolic networks. Outside of the lab, I enjoy experimenting with new food,
   playing games, and fixating on my hobby of the month.

<td class="ppl-bio"><b>Vasu Rao</b> <p class="ppl-title">Graduate Student</p>
I graduated from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign in 2022 with a BS in
Bioengineering, focused on Computational and Systems Biology. I started with the
Jensen Lab at the beginning of my senior year at U of I and have continued here
while starting my MS at the University of Michigan. I am interested in leveraging
statistical and computational machine learning methods to tackle biological problems.
I'm currently working on building a model to predict metabolic consumption patterns
of the oral streptococci. I hope to learn a lot and take on new projects during my
time as a grad student. Outside of research, I enjoy playing chess and basketball,
learning jiu-jitsu, and generally acquiring cool and interesting knowledge about
a broad variety of topics.

<td class="ppl-bio"><b>Noelle Toong</b> <p class="ppl-title">Graduate Student</p>
I received my BS in Neuroscience in 2019, and MS in Automated Science in 2021,
both from Carnegie Mellon University. After working for a year in industry,
I joined the Jensen lab in Fall 2022 as a Biomedical Engineering PhD student.
I am developing a Bayesian framework for predicting bacterial growth in batched
experiments. In my free time, I like to cook, play video games, and play the violin.

<td class="ppl-bio"><b>Noah Schmid</b> <p class="ppl-title">Graduate Student</p>
I received my BS and MS degrees in Bioengineering from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.
I started my research in the Jensen lab in 2019 focused on experimental design and optimization of <i>Streptococcus mutans</i> transformation.
I spent a year after earning my Master’s degree working in the Jensen lab on the BacterAI project before starting a PhD in
Biomedical Engineering at the University of Michigan. I am developing a system to understand the genetic activation of induced competence in <i>S. mutans</i>
 with future plans to use the CRISPR-Cas9 toolset to characterize genes in multiple streptococci. In my free time I am an avid home cook, and I also enjoy watching movies, reading, and playing videogames with friends.
