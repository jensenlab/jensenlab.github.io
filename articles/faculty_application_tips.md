### Personalization

Customizing your application to each school can signal your enthusiasm, or at least your willingness to do a manual mail merge with your application materials. I recommend customizing the cover letter for each application but leaving the rest of the materials the same for each job. Limiting customization to the cover letter reduces the change for errors, but they still happen. Every year a handful of applications arrive at our search committee but are addressed to another school. The search committee understands that mistakes happen, but addressing your materials to another school is the opposite of the desired effect of personalization.

# Cover Letters

**Use your institution's letterhead.** No one told me as a graduate student that I could send letters using the department's letterhead. Nearly everyone else used a letterhead, so ask your adviser or a department admin for a template.

**Use the cover letter to elaborate on your CV.** "Don't repeat what's on your CV" is common advice for cover letters, but it's difficult to introduce yourself to a search committee without recanting at least part of your academic history. The cover letter should provide context or motivation for the line items on your CV. For example:

 - **Bad:** I completed my Ph.D. in biomedical engineering at the University of Virginia and am currently a postdoc in the biology department at Boston College.
 - **Better:** As a graduate student at the University of Virginia, I developed mathematical models to simulate metabolic networks of pathogenic bacteria. I complemented my computational training with an experimental postdoc at Boston College. Here I learned genetic and genomics techniques and generated high-throughput datasets that I integrated with my metabolic models.

Your cover letter can also mention

 - If you were your adviser's first student and helped establish their lab. (Or were the first student in a new area.)
 - If you moved from a postdoc to a staff scientist in the same lab and how your responsibilities changed.
 - How your training relates to your future research directions.

**Don't rely on numbers alone.** Here's a common line from cover letters: "I have published 12 peer-reviewed papers in leading journals and 11 conference proceedings and top conferences." This line reminds me of my high school biology teach who joked that he graded reports by weight. Here are reasons to not lead off with paper counts:

  1. Quality, not quantity, matters. A count of papers tells me nothing more than what I will find when I look at your CV.
  2. Productivity metrics vary by subfield. A highly productive researcher might have a single *Neuron* paper after a four year postdoc, or they might publish two conference papers every year.
  3. The number of *actual* papers always drops upon inspection. Not every paper is in a "leading journal", and some reviewers discount review articles, non-first author publications, or even preprints. Giving a number in the cover letter raises expectations to an impossibly high level, and it's best to avoid disappointing the search committee when they get to your CV.

**Instead, say what you did.** Anyone boasting "12 peer-reviewed papers in leading journals" must have something exciting to say about the contents of those papers. You must have discovered, invented, built, or improve something to warrant all those publications. This is your chance to brand yourself as "the person who did *X*". Would you rather to discussed as "the scRNA-seq immunologist" or just "the postdoc from [institution]"?

**A note on branding.** Make your scientific identity clear; don't require reviewers to piece it together from your career. As a new faculty I received a grant review that listed "a lack of microbiology expertise" as a weakness. At first I was confused -- I had worked with bacteria exclusively for over a decade. Then I realized that "microbiologist" appears nowhere on my biosketch. My degrees are all in engineering, and my postdoc was in a biology department. Many of my papers are in computational biology journals, and I'm listed under the "computational bioengineering" section of our department webpage. None of that screams "microbiologist", I can understand a reviewer not reading between the lines or concluding that my entire career has been spent with bacteria. Your cover letter should unambiguously state who you are: a tissue engineer, an immunologist, or a bioinformaticist.

# CV

**Be 100% honest and transparent.** Never, ever stretch the truth in your CV, even by a little. Almost everything on your CV can be verified online, and reframing something in a more favorable light leaves an horrible impression. Some common "little white lies" I've seen on CVs are

 - *Switching the order of co-first authors*. This practice is frequently debated online, but I argue for leaving author order as is. Others argue that the order of co-first authors is meaningless, so switching doesn't change anything; however, if switching doesn't change anything, then why would you need to switch? It's better to report the author order as found on the paper.
 - *Changing journal names*. My favorite example is *Scientific Reports*, a journal sometimes listed as *Nature Scientific Reports*. Strangely, these CV authors do not add "Elsevier" or "Wiley" to the names of other journals.
 - *Adding yourself to grants*. Listing a grant on a CV typically implies you are a PI or co-PI, i.e. the institution has designated you as having financial control or leadership over part of the grant. Other non-PI researchers can be "Senior/Key Personnel", but I suggest not padding your CV with these. A simple test is if part of the grant would follow you to your new institution; if so, list it on your CV.
 - *Ad hoc reviewing*. Saying you review for a journal implies you (not your adviser) was invited to review by the editor. If your adviser asks you to help with a review, consider asking them to have the editor invite you directly. I've declined review invitations by offering to assist a trainee with the review if the editor invites them directly.

**Make information easy to find on your CV.** A publication on your CV conveys four pieces of information: 1.) who wrote it and your relative position among the authors; 2.) the title; 3.) the journals/conference; and 4.) the date. It's common to see publications formatted like this:

 - Chavali AK, Tlaxca JL, Blazier AS, Jensen PA, Pearson RD, Papin JA. Metabolic network analysis predicts efficacy of FDA-approved drugs targeting the causative agent of a neglected tropical disease. *BMC Systems Biology*. 2012, 6:27.

Instead, consider this:

 - Chavali AK, Tlaxca JL, Blazier AS, <font color=blue>**Jensen PA**</font>, Pearson RD, Papin JA.<br>
**Metabolic network analysis predicts efficacy of FDA-approved drugs targeting the causative agent of a neglected tropical disease.**<br>
*BMC Systems Biology*. 2012, 6:27.

The exact formatting doesn't matter, but I've made it easy to find all four pieces of information by positioning them consistently.

**Take it easy with metrics**. I don't recommend listing metrics (journal impact factors, citations, etc.) for every paper on your CV. These metrics vary by discipline, so a journal's impact factor could just as easily underwhelm rather than overwhelm a reviewer. Citation counts are better than impact factors as they are a measure of your paper and not the journal. Still, I would use citation counts sparingly to highlight a particularly well-cited paper in your record.

On the other extreme, I've seen applicants omit journal names from all publications. These CVs usually include a note saying that journals are an imperfect measure of impact and their papers should be judged by content alone. Regardless of your thoughts on metrics, I don't think a job application is the best place to make a stand on these issues. For better or worse, the search committee gets to decide on the review criteria and must apply them uniformly. I recommend not making more work for the reviewers by omitting information they expect to see in your application.

# Research Statement

**Think big picture.** Most of your writing before your first faculty job was for papers. Papers have a narrower scope than a grant, which is narrower than a research statement. A common mistake is to not step back far enough with evaluating your own research. For example, my graduate work focused on metabolic modeling of bacteria. My job applications at the end of grad school argued 1.) that I used the best methods for metabolic modeling, and 2.) I studied a system where bacterial metabolism was important. These arguments only work if **the search committee has decided to only consider metabolic modelers**. I failed to step back far enough ask what the search committee wants to know:

 1. Is the candidate studying a truly important problem?
 2. Are they studying it in the best way possible?

Reviewers of my papers always asked if I was modeling metabolism correctly, but they never ask why I chose metabolic modeling in the first place. No one at my thesis defense asked why I worked on the problem I did instead of a completely different topic. A search committee, by contrast, doesn't need to decide how good of a metabolic modeler I am. They simply need to decide if they want to hire me or keep looking for someone more exciting in their giant pile of applications.

My advice to think big might seem like too little, too late. You can't change your previous research, but in my experience search committees give a fair bit of leeway in future research directions. I switched from studying respiratory pathogens (grad school and postdoc) to oral microbes that cause tooth decay. Both are important problems, but I had a better argument for why my skills were needed to solve problems in oral microbiology.

**Triangulate from  your mentors.** Speaking of changing directions, the search committee will want to know how your research program differs from your mentors'. I advise people to form a triangle in research space with your grad and postdoc mentors. Saying "my grad adviser did *X* and my postdoc lab does *Y*, so I'm going to do a combined *1/2 X + 1/2 Y*" does not form a triangle. The point *1/2 X + 1/2 Y* lies on a line between your adviser and postdoc mentor. Such projects could be accomplished by a collaboration between your advisers, so why do they need you?

You want move your lab off of the line between your advisers by taking what you know and pushing into new territory. Something about your lab has to be different, and you should feature this difference prominently in your research statement.

Now for some pure conjecture. I believe the area of the triangle is what matters. The closer your grad and postdoc advisers are, the farther you need to go in a new direction to be viewed as independent. If your mentors are already far apart (say a theorist and a cancer biologist), moving only slightly in a new direction still appears independent since a collaboration between your mentors seems more novel or unlikely. And if you're thinking "does this guy always make analogies using vector algebra", the answer is [yes, yes I do](http://jensenlab.net/teaching/).

**Spend more time building up than punching down.**
